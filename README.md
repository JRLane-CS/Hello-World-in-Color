# Overview

### Title 
#### Hello World in Color

### Program Description

This code is designed to run on Windows. It is a simple program (only 11 lines of actual code) that will clear the terminal screen and print "Hello World!" in color. It uses ANSI escape codes to change the color of ASCII printable characters.

It was written to demonstrate one of the ways text can be colored using Python. There are others, such as using the colorama python library, but this method requires no additional libraries. (The os library is included only to clear the screen and is unnecessary regarding the colorization of the text.)

Here is a link to a video showing the code in action:
